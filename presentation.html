                <h2>History</h2>
                <p class="justify">Our ecological video game project was born of a collective desire to raise awareness of environmental issues among the younger generation. At a time when the climate crisis and the destruction of ecosystems are intensifying, we wanted to use video games as a tool for education and engagement. The project takes the form of a 3D action/adventure game, combining platforming, puzzle-solving and combat elements, all set in a world that reflects today's major ecological challenges such as deforestation, ocean pollution and global warming.
        
                    The main aim of this project is to raise public awareness while offering concrete, accessible solutions, thanks to a fun, immersive experience. Through engaging gameplay mechanics, players discover how their actions, both in the game and in real life, can have a positive impact on the environment. By embodying a character who fights against the destruction of nature, the player is made aware of the importance of everyday actions in preserving the planet, while being entertained by a variety of challenges and captivating quests.

                    By offering a video game that is both attractive and meaningful, we hope not only to entertain, but also to inspire our players to take action for a more sustainable future.
                    
                    We firmly believe that this game can play a key role in raising awareness of environmental issues among younger generations, which is why we pay particular attention to every detail to ensure an impactful and educational final product.
